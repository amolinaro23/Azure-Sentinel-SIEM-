# Azure-Sentinel-SIEM-
In this lab, I setup Azure Sentinel and connected it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. This allowed me to observe live attacks, specifically RDP brute force attacks, from all around the world. I then used  PowerShell script (from Josh Madakor) to look up the attackers geolocation information and plotted it on the Azure Sentinel map. 


<h2>Step 1 - Step Up an Azure Sentinel Account (Free)</h2>

I had already created an account for a previous lab, so I do not have screenshots of this particular step... but, if you visit https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ you can sign up for a free account that grants you $200. After all that is done, you'll click on the Virtual Machines icon.
