# Azure-Sentinel-SIEM-
In this lab, I setup Azure Sentinel and connected it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. This allowed me to observe live attacks, specifically RDP brute force attacks, from all around the world. I then used  PowerShell script (from Josh Madakor) to look up the attackers geolocation information and plotted it on the Azure Sentinel map.
